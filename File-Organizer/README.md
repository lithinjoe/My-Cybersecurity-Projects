# Automated File Organizer
* **Purpose:** This script automatically organizes files in a directory by moving them into subfolders based on their file type (e.g., .jpg, .pdf).
* **What I Learned:** This project taught me practical Python scripting for automation, specifically how to interact with the file system to manage files and directories.

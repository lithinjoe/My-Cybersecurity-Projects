# Password Strength Checker

* **Purpose:** This Python tool assesses the strength of a given password based on criteria like length, and the inclusion of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
* **What I Learned:** This project helped me understand the practical side of authentication security and how to provide users with clear, actionable security feedback.
